    <h2>"If you are one of those who think that gravy is some kind of soup, slurping this or mixing it with rice will work too."</h2>
    <p><strong>KFC Gravy recipe</strong> using basic ingredients that should be available in your local supermarket.This gravy recipe that we have here works well with fried chicken and mashed potatoes.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter or vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 piece chicken cube</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a saucepan and put-in the butter. Let the butter melt under low heat.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and cook in low heat while continuously stirring for 7 to 8 minutes or until the color turns medium brown. There is a tendency that the flour might burn when overcooked or if high heat is applied. Be extra cautious.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining flour and continue stirring.</li>
        <li>Gradually add water and chicken cube. Continuous stirring is needed to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
        <li>Put the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes more while stirring once in a while until the texture thickens.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with fried chicken or mashed potato.</li>
